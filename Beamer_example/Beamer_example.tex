\begin{frame}{Stacked difference-in-differences}

\begin{itemize}
\item State data are divided into ``timing groups'' defined by the year in which they experience a change in their state- EITC. States which experience the change in the same year are in the same timing group. 
\item For each timing groups, control group is created which includes all of the states which never adapted EITC. A separate dataset is created for each timing group. In each dataset, states which changed EITC are considered the treatment group, and those which did not in that year form the control group. 
\item  In each data set event time is defined as years since the EITC change. 
\item Each data set is stacked together to create one "long" data set. In this data set, every treated state is included once, however each control state is included for each timing group.

\begin{frame}{Lagged Dependent Variable Model}
\begin{equation} \label{FS_lagged}
Y_{it} = \beta_{1}\textbf{Y'}_{it-1}  +  \beta_{2}\textbf{X'}_{it} +  \beta_{3}\textbf{D}_{it}  +  \textbf{error}_{it} 
\end{equation}
\bigskip
\bigskip

where $Y_{it}$ is food insecurity for $household_{i}$ at $t=4$. The lagged dependent variable or the food security status for each household at $t=2$ is included as $\textbf{Y'}_{it-1}$.  Again, $\textbf{X'}_{it}$ are demographic characteristics and $\textbf{D}_{it}$ is an indicator of a household's out-of-pocket costs.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Lagged Dependent Variable Model - 2}
\begin{multline} \label{FS_lagged2}
Y_{it} = \beta_{1}\textbf{Y'}_{it-1}  +  \beta_{2}\textbf{X'}_{it} +  \beta_{3}\textbf{D}_{it}*\textbf{Z}_{it} +\beta_{3}\textbf{D}_{it}*\textbf{W}_{it} +  \textbf{error}_{it} 
\end{multline}

A householdâ€™s prior round food security is included in the model $\textbf{Y'}_{it-1} $ along with a vector of demographic controls  $\textbf{X'}_{it} $. The treatment variable of household out-of-pocket costs is  $\textbf{D}_{it}$ , the round 3 out-of-pocket costs. $ \textbf{Z}_{it}$ is an indicator for whether the household was food secure in round 2.   $W_{it} $ is an indicator if the household was food insecure in round 2. 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Lagged Dependent Variable Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using a lagged dependent variable in a cross-sectional equation provides a simple way to account for historical factors that cause current differences in the dependent variable that are difficult to account for in other ways.
\bigskip
\item EX: Some households live further away from grocery store. Many of the same unobserved factors contribute to both high current and past food insecurity.
